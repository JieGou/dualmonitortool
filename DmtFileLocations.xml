<!-- Sample of the DmtFileLocations.xml file

	 You only need a DmtFileLocations.xml if you want the data files
	 to reside in a directory other than the one where DMT.exe lives.

	 This file needs to be named "DmtFileLocations.xml" and to reside
	 in the same directory as DMT.exe.  It will not be written to, so
	 is safe to reside under "C:\Program Files (x86)".

	 Normally you would just need to change the location for "datadirectory",
	 unless you wanted finer control over the filenames, or wanted to
	 enable the log file.

	 Environment variables may be used in the paths below, or you can use
	 the explicit pathnames.

	<!-- datadirectory specifies the default home directory
		 for all file locations that are not explicitly set below.
		 This must be a full path, but may include environment variables.
		 You will need to make sure that the directory exists before running DMT. -->
	<filelocation name="datadirectory" value="%APPDATA%\Dual Monitor Tools" />

	<!-- Individual file locations may be the full or relative path.
		 If a relative path is used, then this will be relative to datadirectory if specified,
		 otherwise it will be relative the location of DMT.exe -->
