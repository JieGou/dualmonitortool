<p class="SubHeading">Dual Wallpaper</p>

<p>Dual Wallpaper simplifies the process of using images as wallpaper on multiple monitor setups.</p>

<p>You can have a single image which is spread across all of your monitors, or you can have different images on each monitor, or if you have enough monitors, you could say have an image spread across 2 of your monitors with another image displayed on the third monitor.</p>

<p>It also correctly sets the wallpaper when your primary monitor is not
your leftmost or topmost monitor.</p>

<p class="SubHeading">Usage</p>

<p>When DualWallpaper.exe is run it will look similar to the following.</p>
<img src="Images/DualWallpaper1.png" />
<p>The area at the top of the window displays a representation of how your monitors are arranged logically. It makes sense if your monitors are also arranged physically like this as well, but this may not always be the case.</p>
<p>The screen number is displayed on each monitor, and the primary monitor also has a P after the screen number.</p>
<p>It is possible to select a particular monitor by clicking on its representation in this window.  
You can also select multiple monitors by holding down the control key when you click on the monitors.
The selected monitors are highlighted with a yellow border.</p>


<p>To add an image to one or more screens, first select those screens and then click on the browse button to choose an existing image file to use.  
When you have done this, a thumbnail of the image is shown to the right of the 'Browse' button.</p>

<p>If the aspect ratio of the image is different to the aspect ratio of the rectangle enclosing all of the selected screens, 
then you need to decide how this is to be handled by the 'Fit' combo box.  The available options are:
<ul>
	<li>Stretch ignoring aspect ratio.</li>
	<li>Over stretch and clip to maintain aspect ratio. (default option)</li>
	<li>Under stretch and add bars to maintain aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then click the 'Add Image' button which will add the image to the selected monitors in the preview like the following where a single image was applied to 2 monitors.</p>
<img src="Images/DualWallpaper2.png" />

<p>If you have further monitors, then you can select these and repeat the process using either the same image or a different image.</p>
<p>You can also adjust the position of the image on the currently selected monitors by using the movement controls in the 'Move Image' group box.  For example in the above image, you may want more of the sky visible, so if you press the up button a couple of times, you will end up with the following:</p>
<img src="Images/DualWallpaper3.png" />

<p>When you are happy with the preview, you can click the 'Set Wallpaper' button at which point you should see your new wallpaper displayed on your desktop.</p>
<p>When you use the 'Set Wallpaper' button, the wallpaper image is saved to a file at the following location: %LOCALAPPDATA%\GNE\DualWallpaper\DualWallpaper.bmp.  This means that each time you use this button, you will overwrite the previous wallpaper generated with this application.  If you use a third party wallpaper changer, then instead you may want to save your wallpapers to the directory that this third party application uses by using the 'Save Image' button.</p>
