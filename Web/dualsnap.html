<p class="SubHeading">Dual Snap</p>

<p>Dual Snap allows you to capture the image on the primary monitor and display it on the secondary monitor by the use of a user defined hotkey.  This works with both normal window applications and most full screen applications like most games.<p>
<p>You can take multiple snapshots and review them later and copy them to the clipboard or save them as PNG files.</p>
<p>Dual Snap is still in the experimental stage, but it is expected that it may be of use with applications that have some static information which can not be displayed during the active part of the application.  I have found it quite useful with games where the second screen can be used to display your objectives, or a map or the special abilities of your player.</p>

<p class="SubHeading">Usage</p>

<p>When DualSnap.exe is run it will put itself into the notification area of the taskbar.</p>
<p>Right clicking on the icon, or on the snapped image when it is displayed on the secondary monitor will bring up a context menu which includes the following items:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Snap! - Captures the image on the primary monitor.  This is the same as using the hotkey.</li>
	<li>Show Snap - This is a checked item which allows you to display/hide the current snap on the second monitor.</li>
	<li>Snaps - Shows a list of your previous snaps.  Clicking on one will make it the current snap and display it on the secondary monitor.  The most recent snap will be at the top of the list.</li>
	<li>Copy - Copies the current snap to the clipboard.</li>
	<li>Save As - Saves the current snap to a PNG file.</li>
	<li>Options - Allows you to specify the hotkey to use to take a snap, the maximum number of images that are remembered and whether to display a snap on the secondary monitor as soon as it is taken.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pressing the hotkey at any time will capture the image on the primary monitor and display it on your second monitor, assuming you have the <i>Show snap on second screen when taken</i> checked in the options dialog.  The default value for the hotkey is F9.<p>

<p>If you want DualSnap to start automatically when your computer boots,
then the easiest method is to paste a shortcut to it into the StartUp folder
on the Windows Start menu.<p>

<p class="SubHeading">Known Problems</p>

<p>It doesn't work with some older games, possibly due to different colour depths.  This needs further investigation.</p> 

<p>If you use it on a computer with a single monitor, then the snap is displayed on the primary monitor.  As the snap is static, it may look like the computer has crashed, but if you right-click anywhere on the screen you can uncheck <i>Show Snap</i> to remove the display of the snap.</p>
