<!-- Sample of the DmtFileLocations.xml file

	 You only need a DmtFileLocations.xml if you want the data files
	 to reside in a directory other than the one where DMT.exe lives.

	 This file needs to be named "DmtFileLocations.xml" and to reside
	 in the same directory as DMT.exe.  It will not be written to, so
	 is safe to reside under "C:\Program Files (x86)".

	 Normally you would just need to change the location for "datadirectory",
	 unless you wanted finer control over the filenames, or wanted to
	 enable the log file.

	 Environment variables may be used in the paths below, or you can use
	 the explicit pathnames.
